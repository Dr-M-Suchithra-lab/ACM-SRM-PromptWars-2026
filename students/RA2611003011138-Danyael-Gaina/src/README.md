# FairShift

Fair, safe and transparent work for daily-wage and campus staff (UN SDG 8, Decent Work).

**Live demo:** https://fairshift-alpha.vercel.app

FairShift is one web app for two kinds of employers. Workers check in, see exactly how their pay was calculated, report safety problems anonymously in their own language, and keep a verifiable record of their skills. Employers see attendance, fatigue and overdue safety cases in one dashboard.

Two industries ship in the box: **construction** (daily wages at a site gate) and **college** (monthly salaries for campus support staff). A new sector is one configuration object.

## Screenshots

The demo includes fictional campus and construction workers. Screenshots show the dark theme; users can select Light or Auto in the footer.

Inter, Noto Sans Devanagari and Noto Sans Tamil are bundled with the build, so the interface does not depend on installed fonts or a third-party font service. The low-resolution fluid backdrop respects reduced motion and pauses in hidden tabs.

## The problem

- **Opaque pay.** Workers cannot check how a daily wage, overtime, a night allowance, a provident fund deduction or an advance was calculated.
- **Fear of reporting.** Unsafe conditions and harassment go unreported because workers fear retaliation, and hazards surface only after an incident.
- **Lost career history.** Training and experience live on paper or in memory, so workers cannot prove their skills to the next employer.
- **Employer blind spots.** Overwork, lack of rest days and absence patterns are invisible until someone quits or gets hurt.

## What FairShift does

| Feature | For workers | For employers |
|---|---|---|
| **Check-in with automatic overtime** | Scan the site QR at the gate, or check in by location if within the site radius. Overtime and night hours are calculated on check-out. | A kiosk page shows a rotating site QR (new code every 60 s, page refreshes every 30 s). Shift hours feed payroll and fatigue rules. |
| **Transparent payslip and calendar** | Each line shows its arithmetic, for example "16 days × ₹750". Select Calendar to inspect a date’s completed hours, overtime, night allowance and estimated take-home, with read-aloud in all three languages. Save the payslip through the browser’s Print / Save as PDF dialog, or share its text (copy fallback). | The same line items are produced from the same rules for every worker. Mark or remove site-wide days off under Workers → Site days off. These are schedule notices and never change pay or attendance. |
| **Attendance and pay corrections** | From a calendar date, request corrected shift times, missing work or a signed net pay adjustment. Track the review and its reason. These requests identify the worker and are separate from anonymous reports. | Workers → Attendance & pay corrections provides approval/rejection with a required reason. Approved time changes recalculate attendance, pay and workforce figures; raw shifts and request history remain preserved. Competing reviews use version checks. |
| **Pay comparison** | Expand the comparison with the previous month to see changes in base pay, overtime, night allowance, deductions and net adjustments, with audio. Current-month comparisons are labelled as partial versus a full month. | The comparison uses the same calculated payslips. Demo data includes a separate previous-month history. |
| **Payment receipts and reconciliation** | Compare calculated net pay with the employer's recorded payments for the selected month. Confirm a receipt, report that it was not received, or state a different amount. The receipt and response remain visible. | Record dated payments with references and notes under Workers. Receipts are appended to a separate versioned ledger; the dashboard shows recorded payment gaps and worker disputes. Recording a payment does not transfer money or change payroll. |
| **Upcoming days off** | Home shows the next three active own-site notices, including today, with localized dates and audio. | Existing site-day-off controls feed the Home card. |
| **Anonymous safety reports** | Describe a problem by text or a voice note (up to 60 s), in English, Hindi or Tamil. Get a case code and track status without an account. | Reports come with a category, a severity and a service-level deadline. Overdue cases are flagged. Status changes and notes are visible to the reporter. |
| **Reporter-confirmed fixes** | A new report includes a private response key, saved on the device when storage is available. After an employer reports a fix, use Track to confirm it or reopen the case, with an optional note. The public case code remains read-only. | The report history distinguishes employer updates and reporter responses. Concurrent changes are checked before saving. Older reports without a response key remain trackable. |
| **Recurring site hazards** | Reports continue to be anonymous and contain no worker identity. | A 30-day dashboard summary shows a category only after at least three reports across two days. Old unresolved cases distinguish persistent hazards. Each card opens the category's queue. Counts are reports, not distinct workers, and sparse groups stay hidden. |
| **Fatigue alerts** | See your own alerts for long shifts, short rests, long runs without a rest day and heavy weeks. | A fleet-wide fatigue list with the same rules. |
| **Explainable quit-risk** | Not shown to workers. | A 0 to 100 score with its factors listed (see below). Never uses anonymous reports or feedback. |
| **Skill passport** | See training, certification and experience entries, share a signed link, or Print / Save PDF with the worker’s name, entries, verification QR and link. | Add entries for each worker. Anyone can verify a passport with the platform's public key. |
| **Anonymous feedback** | One response per month rating safety, fairness, respect and workload (1 to 5), with an optional comment. | Averages and comments appear only once a site has at least 5 responses. |

**Fatigue rules** (look-back of 14 days of completed shifts):

- `long_shift`: any shift longer than 12 hours (high).
- `short_rest`: less than 10 hours between two shifts (medium).
- `no_rest_day`: 7 or more consecutive days with a shift (high).
- `weekly_overload`: more than 60 hours in a rolling 7-day window (medium).

**Quit-risk factors** (points added to a 0 to 100 score; low below 30, medium below 60, high from 60):

- `high_overtime`: more than 20 overtime hours in 14 days (+25).
- `fatigue`: +10 per fatigue flag, capped at 30.
- `absences`: +8 per scheduled Monday-to-Saturday day not worked, capped at 24.
- `new_joiner`: tenure under 90 days (+15).
- `declining_attendance`: at least 2 fewer days worked in the last 7 days than the 7 before (+10).

### How a payslip is computed

Money is stored in paise (₹1 = 100 paise). A worked day counts 1 if it has at least 4 hours, and 0.5 if it has fewer.

Example, construction, 16 days at ₹750:

| Line | Calculation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Base | 16 days × ₹750 | ₹12,000.00 |
| Provident fund (deduction) | 12% of base, capped at ₹1,800 | ₹1,440.00 |
| ESI (deduction) | 0.75% of gross, because gross is at most ₹21,000 | ₹90.00 |
| **Net** | 12,000 − 1,440 − 90 | **₹10,470.00** |

Other rules:

- Overtime is paid at 2× the hourly rate. Daily-wage hourly rate is ₹750 / 8 hours.
- Night hours (22:00 to 06:00 IST) earn an allowance per hour.
- Monthly pay (college) is the salary minus each absent working day at salary / 26.
- Advances for the period are shown as their own deduction line.

The calendar is an estimate, not a daily payment ledger. It uses the daily wage or monthly salary / 26 for completed work. EPF and ESI are allocated by each day’s share of the monthly base/gross earnings; salary-balance deductions remain monthly. Salary balances, advances and rounding appear in a monthly adjustment so daily net estimates plus that adjustment equal the monthly payslip. Overnight work belongs to its IST check-in date, matching payroll. Open shifts do not accrue pay until check-out. Income tax is not calculated, and calculated pay does not confirm payment.

## Two industries, one platform

### Construction: Skyline Towers (daily wages)

Workers are paid per day. A Tamil-speaking electrician and a Hindi-speaking helper scan the site QR at the gate each morning. The site supervisor sees who is on site on the dashboard. A 13-hour shift raises a fatigue flag for the supervisor to act on.

A worker reports a near-fall on the fourth floor from the phone. The report is stored without a worker ID, PII is masked, and the case code lets the worker see when the supervisor acknowledged it. The keyword rules rate it critical because of the word "fell", so it is due within a day. With Gemini configured, the model chooses the category and severity instead.

### College: Greenfield College Campus (monthly salaries)

Support staff, such as lab assistants and security guards, are paid a monthly salary for 26 working days. Each absence reduces the base by one day rate. A lab assistant sees their payslip with the absence deduction shown. A spark from a socket in a lab is reported as electrical, which the keyword rules rate high. The facilities manager sees it in the reports queue with its deadline.

### Configuration comparison

From `src/shared/industries.ts`:

| Setting | construction | college |
|---|---|---|
| Pay model | `daily` | `monthly` |
| Base pay | `dailyWage` ₹750 per day | `monthlySalary` ₹18,000 for `workingDaysPerMonth` 26 |
| Regular hours per day | 8 | 8 |
| Overtime multiplier | 2 | 2 |
| Night allowance (22:00 to 06:00 IST) | ₹25 per hour | ₹20 per hour |
| Half-day threshold | 4 hours | 4 hours |
| Hazard categories | 9 (fall_height, scaffolding, electrical, heavy_machinery, ppe_missing, heat_stress, harassment, wage_issue, other) | 8 (electrical, chemical_lab, slippery_floor, fire_safety, workload, harassment, wage_issue, other) |
| Check-in modes | `qr`, `geo` | `qr`, `geo` |

### Adding a hospital or factory

A new sector is added as one entry in `INDUSTRIES` in `src/shared/industries.ts`, typed `Record<Industry, IndustryConfig>`, so the compiler requires it. The `Industry` union in `src/shared/types.ts` gets the new id. Its hazard categories also need `hazard.<id>` labels in `src/web/i18n/en.json`, `hi.json` and `ta.json`. Payroll, attendance, fatigue, quit-risk and reporting code is shared and does not change.

## Privacy and anonymity by design

- **Reports store no identity.** A stored report has no worker ID, no IP address and no time of day, only the IST calendar day. The report route ignores any session cookie. A test checks this even when a session is present.
- **Audio is not stored.** A voice report is sent to Gemini for transcription within that request. The stored record holds text only.
- **PII is masked before storage.** Emails, 12-digit Aadhaar-style numbers (4-4-4), and 10-digit Indian mobile numbers (with optional +91) are replaced with `[redacted]` in both the original and the English text. This is pattern-based, so it is a safeguard, not a guarantee. The Gemini prompt also asks the model to remove names.
- **Case codes** are 8 random characters from an alphabet without 0, 1, I, L or O, shown as `XXXX-XXXX`.
- **Private response keys** are separate from case codes. Only a SHA-256 hash is stored on the server; the key is returned once, kept out of URLs and administrator responses, and required to confirm or dispute a reported fix. Case tracking and status history remain available without the key.
- **Feedback has no user ID.** The one-per-month check stores an HMAC of user, site and month in a separate set, never next to the response. Comments are redacted and shuffled.
- **Small groups stay hidden.** Feedback aggregates are returned only at 5 or more responses. Below that, the API returns only a count.
- **Quit-risk never reads reports or feedback.**
- **Logs are minimal.** Unhandled errors are logged by error name only.

## Accessibility and inclusion

- **Languages.** The interface is available in English, Hindi and Tamil with matching translation keys. Onboarding and the header menu share native-name radio choices, explicit speaker previews and a separate Continue / Use action. Selection remains a draft until confirmed; cancelling keeps the current language. Audio never starts on hover or focus. `<html lang>` follows the confirmed choice, which is remembered in localStorage. Demo role introductions replay in the selected language.
- **Read aloud.** A speaker button on primary actions reads text in en-IN, hi-IN or ta-IN through `speechSynthesis`. It does nothing if the browser has no speech support.
- **Voice input.** Reports can be recorded (up to 60 s). A text box is always available.
- **Icon-first, large targets.** Home screen tiles and buttons have a minimum height of 48 px.
- **Keyboard and focus.** Visible `:focus-visible` outlines, a skip link, and `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
- **Contrast and dark mode.** New visitors start in dark mode. The footer remembers an explicit Light, Dark or Auto choice; Auto follows the system setting. Colours are defined as tokens. Contrast is designed for WCAG AA, but the automated check excludes the colour-contrast rule (see Testing).
- **Works without AI or Google services.** Report triage falls back to keyword rules, and the app runs with an in-memory store.
- **Small downloads.** Worker pages and the admin area load as separate chunks. `npm run build` reports current compressed bundle sizes.

Folder map:

- `src/shared/`: `types.ts` (domain types), `api.ts` (request and response shapes), `industries.ts` (industry configurations). Used by both sides.
- `src/server/index.ts`: boot. `app.ts`: the Hono app and middleware order. `config.ts`: environment.
- `src/server/domain/`: pure functions with no I/O: `payroll.ts`, `attendance.ts`, `fatigue.ts`, `quitRisk.ts`, `qrToken.ts`, `passport.ts`, `anonymity.ts`, `triage.ts`, `time.ts`.
- `src/server/routes/`: `auth`, `attendance`, `pay`, `reports`, `feedback`, `passport`, `admin`.
- `src/server/services/`: `ai.ts` (Gemini with keyword fallback), `people.ts`, `workforce.ts`, `reports.ts`, `calendar.ts`.
- `src/server/store/`: `repo.ts` (interface), `memory.ts`, `firestore.ts`, `seed.ts` (demo data).
- `src/server/middleware/`: `auth.ts` (session and roles), `security.ts` (headers, body limit, rate limit).
- `src/web/`: Preact SPA. `pages/worker`, `pages/admin`, `pages/public`, `components/`, `i18n/` (en, hi, ta), `speech.ts`, `router.ts`.
- `tests/`: mirrors `src/`. `tests/server/domain`, `tests/server/api`, and `tests/web` (jsdom).

## Security

- **Session cookie** `fs_session`: HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Path=/, 12-hour lifetime, and Secure when `NODE_ENV=production` (the Dockerfile sets this). It holds an HS256 JWT signed with `SESSION_SECRET`. Expiry is checked on every request.
- **Headers on every response:** a strict Content-Security-Policy (`default-src 'self'`, scripts and styles from self only, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `object-src 'none'`, `form-action 'self'`); `X-Frame-Options: DENY`; `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`; Permissions-Policy allowing camera, microphone and geolocation for the app only.
- **Rate limits** (in memory, per client IP): 60 requests per minute on `/api/*`, and 10 per minute on `POST /api/reports` and `POST /api/feedback`. Over the limit returns 429 with `Retry-After`.
- **Validation:** every request body and query is checked with zod. Bodies over 2 MB get 413.
- **Roles:** admin routes require the admin role and are limited to the admin's own site. Worker routes require the worker role.
- **No secrets in the repo.** Every secret (`SESSION_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, the Redis token) is read from the host's environment settings. On Cloud Run, Gemini on Vertex AI and Firestore need no key at all: they use the service account through Application Default Credentials.
- **Secrets** come from environment variables or Secret Manager. `.env` files are git-ignored and `.env.example` contains only comments.
- **Container:** multi-stage Dockerfile on `node:22-slim`, dev dependencies pruned, runs as the unprivileged `node` user.

Known limitations:

- The rate limiter is per instance, so limits are approximate across several Cloud Run instances. It keys on the first `X-Forwarded-For` value, which a client can set, so it is not a substitute for a trusted proxy.
- Skill-passport share tokens do not expire. They stay valid as long as the signing key does.

## Try it

The landing page has quick sign-in buttons for four demo personas (the first worker and the admin of each site):

| Persona | Role | Site | Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ravi Kumar | Worker, Mason | Skyline Towers, Chennai (construction) | English |
| Priya Raman | Admin, Site Supervisor | Skyline Towers, Chennai | English |
| Lakshmi Iyer | Worker, Lab Assistant | Greenfield College Campus (college) | English |
| Anand Krishnan | Admin, Facilities Manager | Greenfield College Campus | English |

A two-minute tour:

1. On the first screen, pick a language (English, हिन्दी or தமிழ்).
2. Sign in as **Ravi Kumar**. Open **Pay** to see each payslip line and its arithmetic. Use the speaker button to hear it.
3. Open **Report**, describe a hazard in any language or record a voice note, and note the case code. Open **Track** and enter the code to see its status.
4. Sign out and sign in as **Priya Raman**. The dashboard shows headline figures, a 14-day attendance chart, fatigue alerts and the at-risk workers list. Murugan Selvam (Electrician) is seeded with a run of 13-hour shifts, which raises fatigue flags.
5. Open **Reports** to see overdue flags and change a status with a note. Open **Feedback** to see averages (seven seeded responses, above the minimum of 5). Open **Kiosk** for the rotating check-in QR.
6. Sign in as **Lakshmi Iyer** to see the college configuration: monthly pay and absence deductions.

Check-in needs the kiosk QR from the admin Kiosk page, scanned from a second device, or location within 300 m of Skyline Towers.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.12 or later (the Dockerfile uses 22).

```bash
npm ci
npm run build      # builds the SPA to dist/web and the server to dist/server
npm start          # serves the app and the API on http://localhost:8080
npm run dev        # API on :8080 (tsx watch) plus the Vite dev server, which proxies /api
npm test           # vitest run
npm run typecheck  # server and web TypeScript
npm run lint       # eslint, type-aware strict rules, zero warnings allowed
npm run check      # typecheck, lint and tests in one go
```

Without any environment variables, the app uses the in-memory store, keyword triage and a random session secret. This is the setup the tests and the demo use.

For local overrides, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then uncomment and set the values you need. Both `npm start` and the API in `npm run dev` load `.env` if present. The Vite proxy follows the same `PORT` (8080 by default). Keep the file private.

Environment variables (from `src/server/config.ts` and `.env.example`):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8080` | HTTP port. Cloud Run sets this. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | random per process (local only) | HMAC key for session JWTs, QR tokens, feedback dedupe keys and the passport signing key. **Required on Vercel and Cloud Run**: the server refuses to start without it. |
| `STORE` | `redis` when a Redis endpoint is set, else `memory` | `memory`, `redis` or `firestore`. Any other value stops startup. |
| `DEMO_DAILY_RESET` | `false` | Public demo only: `true` wipes ALL data, including submitted reports, once per IST day and reseeds the demo. Off, the demo is seeded once and never cleared. Redis only. |
| `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | unset | Upstash Redis REST endpoint. Set automatically by the Vercel Marketplace integration. |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | unset | Same endpoint under the Upstash names. Used when the `KV_` names are absent. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | unset | Gemini Developer API key from Google AI Studio (`GOOGLE_API_KEY` also accepted). When set, report triage uses Gemini. Takes precedence over Vertex AI. |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | unset | Without an API key, enables Gemini on Vertex AI (Application Default Credentials). Otherwise keyword triage is used. |
| `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` | `us-central1` | Vertex AI region. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | `gemini-3.8-flash` | Gemini model ID. |
| `GEMINI_TTS_MODEL` | picked automatically | Text-to-speech model for read-aloud on devices without a Hindi or Tamil voice. By default the server lists the models the key can use and picks a flash TTS model. |
| `PASSPORT_PRIVATE_KEY` | derived from `SESSION_SECRET` | Ed25519 private key in PKCS8 PEM (`\n` escapes accepted). When unset, a stable key is derived from `SESSION_SECRET` with HKDF-SHA256, so passports keep verifying across instances and restarts. |
| `VERCEL`, `K_SERVICE` | set by the platform | Vercel and Cloud Run. Their presence makes a missing `SESSION_SECRET` a startup error. |
| `NODE_ENV` | unset | `production` (set in the Dockerfile and on Vercel) makes the session cookie Secure. |

To use Firestore locally, run `gcloud auth application-default login` and set `STORE=firestore` with `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`.

## Deploy to Vercel

The app deploys to Vercel as a static site plus one Node function for `/api/*`. Build settings come from `vercel.json` (`npm run build:web` builds the SPA into `dist/web`; `api/index.ts` serves the API).

1. Import this repository in Vercel (Add New, Project).
2. In the project, open **Storage**, add **Upstash Redis** from the Vercel Marketplace and connect it to the project. This sets `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, and the data then persists in Redis. The demo organisation is seeded once, on the first request.
3. Under **Settings, Environment Variables**, add `SESSION_SECRET`, for example the output of `openssl rand -hex 32`.
4. Optional: add `GEMINI_API_KEY` from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to enable Gemini triage. Without it, keyword triage is used.
5. Deploy. Later pushes to the connected branch deploy automatically.

Without Redis, each function instance keeps its own in-memory data, so reports and check-ins are lost between requests. Always connect a Redis store on Vercel.

## Deploy to Cloud Run (alternative)

The Dockerfile builds the image. Create the session secret first in Secret Manager (a long random string), then:

```bash
gcloud run deploy fairshift --source . --region asia-south1 --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars STORE=firestore,GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_ID,GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1 \
  --set-secrets SESSION_SECRET=fairshift-session:latest
```

The Cloud Run service account needs access to Firestore and Vertex AI, since both use Application Default Credentials. For a persistent passport signing key, store `PASSPORT_PRIVATE_KEY` in Secret Manager and add it with `--set-secrets` the same way. To use Gemini through an API key instead, add `GEMINI_API_KEY` with `--set-secrets`.

## Testing

- Run `npm test` for the complete Vitest suite; the command reports the current test and file counts.
- **Store** (`tests/server/store`): one contract suite runs against the memory repo, the Redis repo and the Firestore repo. The Redis and Firestore runs use in-memory fakes of their clients. The suite also checks that stored reports and feedback contain no worker id, and that the demo seed is claimed once.
- **Services and config** (`tests/server/services`, `tests/server/config.test.ts`): Gemini answers (valid, redacted, unknown category mapped to `other`, errors, timeout and malformed JSON falling back to the heuristic), audio without AI, API key and Vertex client selection, the required `SESSION_SECRET` on Vercel and Cloud Run, the derived passport key, and store selection.
- **Domain rules** (`tests/server/domain`): payroll arithmetic, attendance hours and night overlap, the four fatigue rules, quit-risk factors, QR token windows, anonymity (case codes, PII masking, feedback aggregation and dedupe key), passports (sign and verify), time and IST day buckets, and keyword triage.
- **API** (`tests/server/api`): authentication and roles, check-in and check-out, pay, reports (including the anonymity guarantees and the 422 for audio without AI), feedback, passports, admin routes (including site scoping and the at-risk list), security headers (CSP and permissions policy), the 60 and 10 per-minute rate limits, and the 2 MB body limit.
- **Web** (`tests/web`): the router, i18n (Hindi and Tamil have exactly the English keys, placeholders match, and every hazard category has a label), language persistence, Indian paise formatting, the landing, admin and payslip screens, and axe-core accessibility checks on the landing, worker home and payslip screens. The colour-contrast rule is turned off in that check.
- **Not covered by automated tests:** live calls to Upstash Redis, Firestore and Gemini. Those paths are exercised against fakes only, so the first real deploy is the first live check.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck, lint, tests and the build on every push and pull request.
- **Code quality gates:** TypeScript `strict` plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`; ESLint `strictTypeChecked` and `stylisticTypeChecked` with complexity (15), function-length (120) and file-length (350) limits, and `--max-warnings=0`. `.editorconfig` pins UTF-8, LF and 2-space indentation.

## SDG 8 alignment

- **Target 8.5, decent work and equal pay:** pay rules are stated and computed the same way for every worker, with each line and its arithmetic visible to the worker. The app does not compare pay between workers.
- **Target 8.7, forced labour:** hours and rest are visible to workers and employers. Long shifts, short rests, long runs without a rest day and heavy weeks are flagged, and every deduction, including advances, is itemised on the payslip.
- **Target 8.8, labour rights and safe working environments:** anonymous safety and welfare reporting with case codes and deadlines, fatigue alerts, and anonymous feedback that is shown only when it protects respondents.

This is alignment with the targets, not a compliance claim.
