## 1. Problem statement

*As given in the event brief, PROMPT WARS 2026 × SRM ACM STUDENT CHAPTER.*

### FairShift: Decent Work Platform
**Building fairer, safer, and more transparent workplaces for employee-intensive organisations.**
**Theme:** UN SDG 8 — Decent Work and Economic Growth

#### The Problem Context: Manual Workforce Management
Large workforces still rely on paper registers, spreadsheets, and WhatsApp groups across key sectors:
- **Construction:** Daily shift workers on active sites.
- **Colleges & Schools:** Campus support and facility staff.
- **Hospitals:** Round-the-clock care and sanitation teams.
- **Factories:** High-volume floor and line operators.

#### Worker Pain Points: Why Workers Struggle Today
- **Opaque Pay Calculations:** Unclear salary breakdowns or uncounted overtime hours.
- **Fear of Identification:** Hesitation to raise complaints or share honest feedback.
- **Unreported Safety Risks:** Workplace hazards ignored until actual injuries occur.
- **Lost Career History:** Unrecorded skills force workers to restart from zero.

#### Systemic Gaps: Employer Blind Spots & User Needs
**For Employers**
- **Zero Workforce Visibility:** No clear view of overworked or unhappy staff.
- **High Attrition Risk:** Unable to spot employees likely to quit early.
- **Delayed Escalation:** Issues reach management only after becoming severe.

**Accessibility Needs**
- **Regional Languages:** Workers primarily communicate in native local tongues.
- **Limited Literacy:** Interfaces must support voice and visual cues.
- **Basic Smartphones:** Must run smoothly on low-end mobile devices.

#### The Mission: Your Hackathon Challenge
Make work fairer, safer, and more transparent for everyone.
Empower workers with clarity and voice while giving employers actionable insights into workforce health.

**Cross-Industry Requirement (2+ Sectors):** Your platform must work across at least two distinct industries
(e.g., Construction Site + College).

#### Example Features
**Transparency & Safety Tools**
1. **Shift Tracking:** QR or location check-in with automatic overtime.
2. **Clear Payslips:** Simple salary breakdown in worker's native language.
3. **Safety Reporting:** Voice or text hazard reports with status tracking.
4. **Honest Feedback:** Anonymous reviews on managers and working conditions.

**Growth, Wellbeing & Insights**

5. **Skill Passport:** Portable digital record of training and experience.
6. **Fatigue Alerts:** Flags excessive hours or back-to-back shifts.
7. **Admin Dashboard:** Tracks attendance trends, complaints, and quit risks.
8. **Voice & Local:** Multilingual voice support for low-end smartphones.

#### Deliverables: What You Need to Submit
- **3+ Working Features:** Functional prototype (custom ideas welcome).
- **2 UIs, Dual Interfaces:** One for workers, one for employers/admins.
- **2+ Industry Use Cases:** Short explanation of cross-sector adoption.

#### Evaluation Rubric: How Projects Will Be Judged
| Judging Criterion | Core Focus Area |
|---|---|
| 1. Real-World Impact | Tangible improvement to worker safety and employer visibility |
| 2. Relevance to SDG 8 | Direct alignment with Decent Work and Economic Growth |
| 3. Inclusivity & Ease of Use | Accessible for regional languages, low literacy, and basic phones |
| 4. Technical Implementation | Clean code quality, security, and working dual interfaces |
| 5. Feasibility & Scalability | Practical adoption across two or more distinct industries |

## 2. Solution

ShiftSaathi is a voice-first phone app for workers and a dashboard for employers. A worker checks in by scanning the
site's QR code, sees a payslip explained line by line, and can talk to it in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada or English
to ask about pay and hours, report a hazard or give anonymous feedback, all from live data. Employers see who is on
site, who needs rest and who might quit, and watch hazards escalate when deadlines are missed. **A built-in payment
gateway (PhonePe) lets the employer settle each worker's wages from the platform itself**: the amount comes straight
from the payslip, and the worker sees the date they were paid.

## 3. Tools used

| Gemini tool | What it does in ShiftSaathi |
|---|---|
| **Gemini 3.1 Flash Live** (`gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview`, Gemini API) | The worker's real-time voice assistant: listens and answers in five Indian languages, with live captions and interruption |
| **Gemini Live function calling** | Five tools that turn speech into actions on live data: payslip, hours and fatigue, report status, filing a hazard, giving feedback |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash Live native audio on Vertex AI** (`gemini-live-2.5-flash-native-audio`) | The same assistant with no API key, signed in as the Cloud Run service |
| **Gemini native-audio voices** (Kore, Charon, Algenib, Iapetus) | The assistant's voice in the app, and the narrator and worker voices in the demo film |
| **Google AI Studio** | The Gemini API key, kept in Google Secret Manager on Cloud Run |

## 4. How to run

The full code is in [`src/`](src). **Prerequisites:** Python 3.11 or newer, Node.js 22 and npm, Git. No database and
no API keys are needed to run the app. The voice assistant and payroll payments need their keys (see
[Environment variables](#environment-variables)) and say so on screen when they are missing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dr-M-Suchithra-lab/ACM-SRM-PromptWars-2026.git
cd ACM-SRM-PromptWars-2026 && git checkout RA2311056010137-ArnavMehta
cd students/RA2311056010137-ArnavMehta/src
cp .env.example .env                 # every value may stay empty for a local run

# 1. Build the web app into static files
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..
ln -sfn ../frontend/out backend/static   # the API serves the built pages

# 2. Install and start the API
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8080 --env-file ../.env
```

Open http://localhost:8080. API docs are at http://localhost:8080/docs outside production.
On the first start the app generates development keys into `backend/.dev-secrets.json` (git-ignored), so
sign-ins and signed passports survive a restart.

**Run the checks** (the same as CI):

```bash
cd backend && python -m pytest -q
cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

**Hot reload for the web app (optional):** set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000` in `.env`, start the API
as above, then in `frontend/` run `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080 npm run dev`.

On Windows, use `python -m venv .venv` and `.venv\Scripts\activate`, and copy `frontend/out` to `backend/static`
instead of linking it.

## 6. Key prompts

The six prompts that shaped ShiftSaathi most. They are also in [`prompts.md`](prompts.md).

**1. The idea and the two sides**
> I want to build something for daily-wage and shift workers in India: masons on building sites, nurses on night
> shifts, college staff, factory workers. Right now everything is on paper registers and WhatsApp. Give me one app
> with two faces: a simple phone app for the worker and a dashboard for the employer. Seed it with one real-looking
> site per sector (a construction site in Chennai, a hospital, a college in Bengaluru, a textile factory in Tiruppur)
> so the demo feels alive from the first click.

**2. Pay that a worker can actually understand**
> Work out the payslip from the shifts, following Indian labour law: overtime after 9 hours a day or 48 hours a
> week, paid at double rate, then PF at 12% of basic and ESI only below the wage ceiling. Every line on the payslip
> should say how it was calculated, like "130.8 h × ₹95 × 2", and there should be a button that reads it aloud.
> Keep each rule a small pure function with its own tests.

**3. Safety reports that can't be ignored**
> When a worker reports a hazard, give it a deadline based on how dangerous it is: 4 hours if it's critical, a day
> if high, three days if medium, a week if low. If the supervisor misses it, move it to the site manager; if it's
> still open at twice the deadline, send it to HR and Safety. Let the worker stay anonymous but still follow their
> own report.

**4. Feedback without fear**
> Workers won't be honest if they think the manager can find out who said what. Store feedback with no worker id at
> all, encrypt the comments, and don't show anything for a site until at least five different people have answered.
> One worker sending five replies must not be enough to unlock it. Prove it with tests.

**5. Just talk to it**
> Many workers can't read a screen comfortably. Add a Talk button that opens a live voice conversation with Gemini
> in whatever language the app is set to: Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada or English. It should greet the worker by
> name. When they ask about pay or hours, it must call a tool and read the real numbers, never guess. It should be
> able to file a hazard or feedback just from what they say: work out the category and how dangerous it is itself,
> ask only for what's missing, read it back once, and show a confirmation on screen when it's done.

**6. Paying wages**
> Add payroll. The employer picks a month and presses Pay next to a worker, and it goes through PhonePe. The amount
> must come from the payslip on the server, never from the browser. Only mark it paid once PhonePe confirms it, check
> the amount matches, accept the webhook only with the right credentials, and never let a month be paid twice. Show
> the payment date on the worker's payslip.

### Four sectors, one platform

The demo is seeded with one site per sector the problem statement names; the same rules apply to all.

| Sector | Demo site | What ShiftSaathi changes there |
|---|---|---|
| Construction | Skyline Towers, Chennai | Daily-wage masons see overtime past 9 h a day or 48 h a week paid at double rate (Factories Act s.51, s.54, s.59); fall hazards carry a 4-hour deadline. |
| Hospitals | City General, Chennai | Night shifts with under 11 hours' rest are flagged before fatigue causes mistakes on the ward. |
| Colleges & schools | Riverside, Bengaluru | With only three feedback responses, the site's comments stay hidden so no one can be singled out. |
| Factories | Sri Lakshmi Textiles, Tiruppur | A removed machine guard climbs to HR & Safety when the site misses its deadline. |

## Voice assistant: the app for workers who can't read it

Many shift workers read little, have never filled in a form, and are scared that a complaint can be traced back to
them. So the worker app has a **Talk** button on every screen. The worker taps it and speaks normally in **Hindi,
Tamil, Telugu, Kannada or English**. The assistant answers out loud in the same language and does the job for them.
They don't need to know which screen, which button or which category to pick.

### What a worker can do just by talking

| The worker says (in their own language) | What happens | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| "How much will I get this month?" · "Was my overtime counted?" | Reads this month's payslip at that moment: days worked, regular and overtime hours, gross and take-home, in rupees | `get_payslip` |
| "Am I working too much?" · "How many hours this week?" | Reads the last 7 days of shifts and any fatigue warning with its reasons (over 60 h, no day off, under 11 h rest) | `get_wellbeing` |
| "What happened to the problem I reported?" | Reads the status of each of their safety reports: open, in progress or resolved, who has it now, and whether it is overdue | `list_my_reports` |
| "The railing on the 9th floor is broken" | **Raises a safety concern.** Works out the category and how dangerous it is, asks only for what's missing (usually where), reads it back once and files it. It goes to the supervisor with a fix-by deadline, and is filed anonymously if the worker asks | `report_hazard` |
| "The supervisor shouts when we ask about pay" | **Gives anonymous feedback.** Works out the topic (manager, pay, safety or conditions), asks for a 1–5 rating only if none was given, reads it back and sends it. The assistant tells the worker it is anonymous, because that fear is why people stay quiet | `give_feedback` |

Check-in and check-out stay on the QR scan, so a shift can't be started without being at the site.

### Always live data, never a guess

- **Every number comes from a tool call made when the worker asks.** The assistant is told never to guess or
  remember pay, hours or report status. It calls the server, which reads the current shifts, payslip and reports,
  so the answer matches the app to the rupee, including a shift that ended a minute ago.
- **Voice uses the same code as the buttons.** The tools call the same functions in `services.py` as the REST routes.
  A hazard filed by voice gets the same deadline, escalation path and anonymity as one filed by tapping, and appears
  on the employer's dashboard straight away, marked as filed by voice.
- **Actions are confirmed on screen as well as out loud.** When a report or feedback is saved, a confirmation card
  appears in the conversation (for a report: who has it and the fix-by deadline), so the worker can see it really went through.
- **The tools are limited to the worker's own data.** The socket accepts only a signed-in worker's token, and every tool
  works on that worker only. Ratings are clamped to 1–5 and text is cut to the same limits as the forms.

### Built for people new to smartphones

- **The assistant speaks first.** It greets the worker by name and asks how it can help, so they know it is listening.
- **Language follows the screen.** The language picked in the app is the one the assistant speaks. If the worker
  starts speaking another language, it switches.
- **Short sentences, everyday words, amounts in rupees.** It never makes the worker choose a category or a severity.
- **The worker can interrupt.** Speaking over the assistant stops it straight away.
- **Captions** of both sides appear on screen, for noisy sites and for checking what was understood.
- **Safety first.** If someone is in immediate danger, it tells them to move away and call 112 before anything else.
- **If voice isn't available** (no key set, or no network), the app says so in the worker's language and every
  action stays available through the buttons.

**Example (Tamil, translated):**

> **Assistant:** Hello Murugan, how can I help with your pay, hours or safety today?<br>
> **Murugan:** The scaffolding near the east crane is shaking, someone could fall.<br>
> **Assistant:** That is dangerous. I'll report a high-risk fall hazard at the east crane scaffolding, with your name. Shall I send it?<br>
> **Murugan:** Yes, but don't put my name.<br>
> **Assistant:** Sent anonymously. The site supervisor has to fix it within 24 hours.<br>
> *Card on screen: "Report sent. Site supervisor must fix it by 30 Oct, 11:05 PM."*

## Architecture

One Cloud Run container: FastAPI serves the JSON API, the `/ws/voice` socket and the exported Next.js app from
one origin. Secrets come from Secret Manager at start-up, and the voice assistant talks to Gemini Live.

Routes stay thin: they validate the request, check the role and call `services.py`. The voice assistant calls
the same services, so every number it speaks comes from the same rules as the screen.

## Key flows

### A shift, from check-in to payslip

The worker scans the site's QR poster; the API checks the code belongs to their site and, when the phone sends a
location, that they are within the site's radius. The payslip splits hours per ISO week into regular and overtime
(past 9 h a day or 48 h a week, paid at double rate), then deducts PF and ESI, and every line can be read aloud.

### A hazard report and its deadline

A report starts with the site supervisor. Its deadline depends on severity (critical 4 h, high 24 h, medium 72 h,
low 7 days). Missed once, it moves to the site manager; missed by twice the deadline, to HR & Safety. Reports
filed by voice follow exactly the same path.

### Anonymous feedback

A rating and comment are stored with the site and ISO week only; the comment is sealed with AES-256-GCM. The
worker's voter tag goes into a separate per-site set. Until five different people have answered, the dashboard
shows a lock; after that, comments are decrypted, shuffled and shown without dates.

### Paying wages through PhonePe

In **Payroll** the employer picks a month and presses **Pay** next to a worker. The server works out the amount from that worker's payslip, so the browser never sets it. When PhonePe sends the
employer back, the server asks PhonePe for the order's real state rather than trusting the return link, and
accepts it only if the amount matches. PhonePe's webhook is a second confirmation, accepted only with the SHA-256 of
the username and password set on the dashboard. A month can't be paid twice, and the worker's payslip then shows the
payment date and PhonePe transaction.

To try it, create a PhonePe business test account, put its sandbox credentials in `.env` (`PHONEPE_CLIENT_ID`,
`PHONEPE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PHONEPE_CLIENT_VERSION`), and point its webhook at `https://<your-host>/api/payments/phonepe/webhook`
with the username and password from `PHONEPE_WEBHOOK_USER` / `PHONEPE_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD`. Without them, Payroll still
shows every amount and says payments are not set up.

### A voice conversation

The app opens `/ws/voice` with the worker's token and the language on screen. The server starts a Gemini Live session
in that language with the worker's context and five tools. Questions become tool calls into `services.py`, so every
number is read live. Actions are saved through the same services as the buttons and confirmed on screen.

## Error handling and input validation

- **Every request body is a typed Pydantic model** (`schemas.py`) with bounds on every field: phone is 10 digits,
  PIN 4 digits, text has length limits, ratings 1 to 5, months `YYYY-MM`, categories and languages from fixed
  lists. Bad input is refused with a `422` before any route code runs.
- **Expected failures return a clear status and a plain message** the app shows as is: wrong PIN (`401`), too many
  tries (`429`), wrong role (`403`), wrong site or too far away (`422`), already checked in or already paid
  (`409`), unknown record (`404`), PhonePe unreachable (`502`), payments not set up (`503`).
- **Unexpected errors** are caught by one handler in `main.py`: the full trace goes to the server log, the client
  gets a `500` with a generic message and no internal detail (tested in `test_api.py`).
- **Configuration errors stop the server at start-up** rather than at the first request: a missing or wrong-length
  key in production raises with the variable's name.
- **The web app** shows the server's message on failure, signs the user out on `401`, and keeps working
  without voice or payments when those aren't configured.

## How it meets the judging criteria

| Criterion | Where to look |
|---|---|
| **Problem alignment** | Every item in the brief is built: shift tracking (`services.check_in`), clear payslips (`payroll.py`), safety reporting (`safety.py`), honest feedback (`feedback.py`), Skill Passport (`crypto.PassportSigner`), fatigue alerts (`wellbeing.fatigue`), admin dashboard (`routes/admin.py`), voice in local languages (`voice.py`), plus wage payment through PhonePe (`payments.py`) and an iPhone app (`ios/`). Two interfaces, four sectors. |
| **Code quality** | Each rule is a small pure function with its reasons returned; routes stay thin and call `services.py`; one shared UI kit (`components/ui.tsx`); typed request bodies (`schemas.py`) and typed responses (`lib/api.ts`); ESLint and TypeScript `strict` with no unused code. |
| **Security** | No secrets in the repo, Secret Manager at runtime, a fail-fast start in production, scrypt PINs with lockout, JWT with role checks, bounded inputs, AES-256-GCM, Ed25519, HMAC reporter tags, CSP and HSTS. See [Security](#security-and-privacy). |
| **Efficiency** | One container and one origin; the web app is static files; about 130 KB of JavaScript for the worker app; fonts load per script; hashed assets cached for a year; pages poll every 15 s only while visible. |
| **Testing** | 76 pytest tests: labour rules, encryption and signatures, every API flow and role check, error handling, the voice tools, translation completeness and colour contrast. CI runs them, plus ESLint (Next.js rules), a strict type check and a production build, on every push. |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG AA contrast enforced by a test, 48 px touch targets, a skip link, visible focus, labelled controls, `lang` set per language, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected, read-aloud and pictures for low literacy. |

## Security and privacy

- **Feedback is anonymous by construction.** Feedback records hold no worker id, only the ISO week. Comments
  are sealed with **AES-256-GCM**, with the site id bound in as associated data, and a site's comments are
  only decrypted once 5 or more *different* people have answered. People are counted with a keyed voter tag
  stored apart from the answers, so one worker sending five replies cannot unlock them alone.
- **Anonymous hazard reports** carry an HMAC-SHA256 reporter tag (key derived with HKDF), so the reporter
  can follow their own report while no screen shows who sent it. Anonymous reports never feed the
  manager-visible quit-risk score.
- **Skill Passports** are signed with **Ed25519**. A new employer verifies one at `/verify` without an
  account; changing one character breaks the signature. The credential travels in the URL fragment, which
  browsers never send to server logs.
- **Payments can't be faked or inflated.** PhonePe payments are created server-side from the payslip amount, and
  a payment only counts once PhonePe itself confirms it, through the status API or an authenticated webhook. The
  client secret never leaves the server, and the server uses PhonePe's sandbox unless production is set on purpose.
- **No keys in the code.** `.env` files are git-ignored and docker-ignored; only `.env.example` without values is
  committed. On Cloud Run the keys come from Secret Manager and the server refuses to start in production without them.
- Phone + 4-digit PIN sign-in, PINs hashed with scrypt, 5 wrong tries lock the number for 5 minutes,
  12-hour JWTs, role checks on every route, bounded input on every field, the voice token sent in the first
  message rather than the URL, and strict headers (CSP, HSTS, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `nosniff`).

## Accessibility and low-end phones

- Every text colour meets WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1), checked by `tests/test_web_assets.py`; touch targets are
  48 px or larger; there is a skip link; keyboard focus is always visible; motion stops under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- The whole worker interface is in English, हिन्दी, தமிழ், తెలుగు and ಕನ್ನಡ; pictures and faces carry meaning
  for workers who read little; payslips can be read aloud with the phone's own speech engine; the voice
  assistant answers in the language on screen.
- The worker app loads in about 130 KB of JavaScript and installs as a web app.

## Tests

```bash
cd backend && python -m pytest -q      # 76 tests
```

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test_rules.py` | Overtime (daily vs weekly), PF and ESI, fatigue rules, quit risk, escalation, the Fair Workplace Index |
| `test_privacy.py` | AES-256-GCM tamper and wrong-key failures, the 5-people threshold, Ed25519 forgery, reporter tags |
| `test_api.py` | Sign-in and lockout, role checks, check-in geofence, anonymous reports, encrypted storage, one worker unable to unlock feedback, passports, headers, the 500 handler |
| `test_payments.py` | Amount taken from the payslip, status checked with PhonePe, wrong amount refused, webhook authentication, no double payment, managers only |
| `test_voice.py` | Session language, greeting, payslip and hazard tools, feedback clamping, unknown tools |
| `test_web_assets.py` | Every language has every string and placeholder; every text colour passes WCAG AA |

## Deploy to Google Cloud Run

The `Dockerfile` builds the web app and the API into one image; Cloud Run builds it from source.

```bash
PROJECT=your-project-id
gcloud config set project $PROJECT
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  secretmanager.googleapis.com

# three random 32-byte app secrets, and the Gemini key (typed in, never saved to a file)
for s in data-key passport-signing-key jwt-secret; do
  python3 -c "import os,base64;print(base64.b64encode(os.urandom(32)).decode(),end='')" |
    gcloud secrets create shiftsaathi-$s --data-file=-
done
read -rs GEMINI && printf %s "$GEMINI" | gcloud secrets create shiftsaathi-gemini-key --data-file=- && unset GEMINI

# let the service read them
SA=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT --format='value(projectNumber)')-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT --member=serviceAccount:$SA --role=roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor

gcloud run deploy shiftsaathi --source . --region asia-south1 --allow-unauthenticated \
  --max-instances 1 --timeout 3600 --session-affinity \
  --set-secrets DATA_KEY=shiftsaathi-data-key:latest,PASSPORT_SIGNING_KEY=shiftsaathi-passport-signing-key:latest,JWT_SECRET=shiftsaathi-jwt-secret:latest,GEMINI_API_KEY=shiftsaathi-gemini-key:latest
```

`--max-instances 1` because demo data lives in memory (see `store.py`); `--timeout 3600` keeps voice calls
open. To run voice on Vertex AI with no key at all, drop the Gemini secret, set
`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=$PROJECT`, and grant the service account `roles/aiplatform.user`. The health check is `GET /health`.

## iPhone app

`ios/` is a native shell around the live worker app: it opens straight on the worker sign-in, scans the site QR
with the iPhone camera (Safari's web view has no barcode reader), and lets the voice assistant use the microphone.
Because the page itself comes from Cloud Run, the app always shows the latest release.

```bash
cd ios && xcodegen          # regenerates ShiftSaathi.xcodeproj from project.yml
open ShiftSaathi.xcodeproj  # pick your team under Signing & Capabilities, then Run on your iPhone
```

## Known limits

- Data is in memory and resets to the demo seed on restart; production would move `store.py` to Firestore.
- A week that straddles two months is judged only on its days inside the payslip's month.
- Live updates poll every 15 s rather than being pushed.
- Payroll uses PhonePe Standard Checkout in sandbox, so wages are collected into the merchant account; sending
  them on to each worker's bank or UPI needs PhonePe's payouts product.
- The CSP allows inline scripts, which Next.js's static export needs for hydration; a nonce-based policy
  would need server rendering.
